                <p class="about-text">When I was younger, my sister and I had it all planned out: She was going to be a writer, and I’d be the illustrator for her stories.</p>

                <p>That hasn’t quite happened yet.</p>
                    
                <p>But I am studying to be a visual designer, and I firmly believe that design can – and should – tell a story.</p>
                    
                <p>I’m currently a fourth year at Northwestern University where I’m majoring in Journalism, minoring in Psychology and pursuing the Segal Design certificate. I feel most fulfilled when I’m doing creative work, whether that be graphic design, photography or making keychains. Here are some of my proudest creative accomplishments:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>I served as creative director for North by Northwestern, NU’s award-winning student-run magazine.</li>

                    <li>This past winter, I learned about the intersection of media, design and technology on Northwestern’s Bay Area Immersion program in San Francisco.</li>
                
                    <li>Most recently, I’m working part-time as a design intern at Hearst StoryStudio!</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Outside of school, you can find me in some arena of sports. I’m either playing for my club volleyball team or swimming, photographing games for Northwestern Athletics or watching football at Ryan Field (although I’m convinced I’m a curse to the team’s success).</p>

                <p>Watch me build my design storytelling skills here!</p>

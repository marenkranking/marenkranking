                <p class="about-text">When I was younger, my sister and I had it all planned out: She was going to be a writer, and I’d be the illustrator for her stories. We were going to be famous.</p>

                <p>That hasn’t quite happened yet.</p>
                    
                <p>But I have grown up to become a visual designer, and <span class="blue-highlight">I love how design can – and should – tell a story.</span></p>
                    
                <p>I recently graduated from Northwestern University with a B.S. in Journalism, as well as a minor in Psychology and a certificate from the Segal Design Institute.
                   This winter, I coded visual, interactive stories as a digital design and development intern at the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>. Now I'm interning with Hearst DevHub, where I'm building tools and templates that make data-driven, interactive storytelling more accessible to local newsrooms.</p>
                
                <p>Outside of work, you can find me playing beach volleyball, at a trivia night or <s>wiping out on a surfboard</s> learning how to surf!</p>

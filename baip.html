                <p class="subheading">the project</p>

                <p>As part of Northwestern’s media-and-tech focused Bay Area Immersion Program, my cohort took a class called Visual Storytelling for the Web. In it, we were encouraged to push past the often static presentation of journalism on digital platforms and learned the tools to make our own stories interactive.</p>

                <p class="pullquote">My group's goal: to write a longform, interactive feature on the rise in popularity of film photography despite the increasing cost of materials.</p>

                <p class="subheading">the process</p>

                <p class="pullquote">First, we researched recent film price trends.</p>

                <p>One of the members of our group was an avid photographer and had already heard about the price hikes, but we needed to find data to legitimize our angle. And we found it – the prices of film equipment have steadily increased since 2007.</p>

                <p class="pullquote">Next, we talked to people.</p>

                <div class="interview-group">
                    <img class="interview-photo" src="images/baip/bts-interview.jpg">
                    <img class="interview-photo" src="images/baip/bts-photo.jpg">
                </div>

                <ul>
                    <p>We interviewed the people who are experiencing both the increase in film popularity and the increase in prices, including:</p>
                    <li>a Bay Area film photographer about how rising prices have changed the way he does his job</li>
                    <li>the owner of a San Francisco film photography shop, who had recently been consistently selling out of film</li>
                    <li>a student just starting out in photography by taking a class</li>
                </ul>

                <img id="wireframe" src="images/baip/wireframe.png">

                <p class="pullquote">We then put it all together in an interactive, visual format that made understanding the material easy.</p>

                <p>After beginning with a wireframe of the story prototype, I built the webpage using JavaScript and GSAP. We played into the film motif of the story: I formatted the introduction as a strip of film that scrolls sideways, layered photos on top of each other and implemented a dark visual theme to the page. By keeping visuals at the forefront of the story, we enhanced what could otherwise be an article bogged down by price stats and econ explainers.</p>

                <p class="subheading">the solution</p>
